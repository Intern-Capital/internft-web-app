      "InterNFTs was an idea that a few of us who were talking about how interns' lives are (eating ramen, working without a salary, experiencing for the experience) and we wanted to celebrate that. Initially an idea worked out to be some sort of a pass for Intern Capital, InterNFTs have now become more of a cultural thing for interns in web3, from all chains. The idea that this NFT was made was to imitate how an intern would've lived their life, from the bottom rocks, all the way to wagmiland.",

    description:
      "So each InterNFT represents an intern. They have multiple traits, but the biggest representation of them are the stress levels, shown by the amount of fire in the background. Their function as an NFT initially functions as 'a person', they are able to be staked into our two vaults, namely to work for the rewards underneath it, whether it's our currency OR for experience, which then they could spend it in our shops in the future. We can think of the interns as ourselves. We work day and night to earn our share, and we spend it on the things we value. Indirectly, we're the interns, and the interns are us.",
